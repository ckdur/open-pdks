# We need only the following:

# Run FasterCap

# We base our extraction on whatever IHP did also

# M3oM1uM4 M3oM1uM5 M3oM1uM6 M3oM1uM7
# (and so on...)

# We require the following
make -C custom -f rcx.mk  1v2_fc 3v1_fc 3v2_fc

# Parse it
make -C custom -f rcx.mk  parse

# Make the rcx model file
make -C custom -f rcx.mk gen
